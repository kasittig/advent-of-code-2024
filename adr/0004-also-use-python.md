# Create a Python subdirectory / subproject

## Context and Problem Statement

I want to actually complete some Advent of Code puzzles this year.

Previously, I decided to use Javascript. It turns out that I'm not very good at Javascript. I should pick a second language.

## Considered Options

- Go
- Rust
- Python

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Python, because even though it would be fun to try Go or Rust, I want to actually complete some puzzles this year.

### Consequences

- Good, because I'll get to manage a monorepo with multiple programming languages.
- Bad, because I'll have to manage a monorepo with multiple programming languages.
