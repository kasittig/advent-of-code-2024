# Use GitHub Pages For Web Hosting

## Context and Problem Statement

Since I have decided to use JavaScript to solve the 2024 Advent of Code challenges, I will be writing a web app. I need to pick a web hosting platform in order to show off my work.

## Considered Options

* GitHub Pages
* MIT Scripts
* Other paid web hosting
* Run my own server

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: GitHub Pages, because it's free, easy to set up, and will serve as a good deployment model for others viewing the repository.
