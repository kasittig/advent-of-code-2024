# Write solutions using JavaScript / React

## Context and Problem Statement

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge that features one coding challenge each day from December 1 to December 25.

In order to participate in the 2024 challenge, I need to pick a programming language.

## Considered Options

* Python
* JavaScript
* Rust

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: JavaScript, because I already have extensive experience programming in Python and I would like to improve my front end development skills.
