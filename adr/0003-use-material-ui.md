# Use Material UI Components

## Context and Problem Statement

React web applications are built using components. Component libraries make it much easier to develop web applications because they save developers the trouble of needing to design and build their own components.

## Considered Options

* [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
* Create my own components
* Some other option

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: MaterialUI, because it's well-supported and well-used, it's free and licensed under the MIT license, and I don't think it's worth the effort to create my own components at this time.

Bonus: MaterialUI uses Roboto, my preferred personal font, by default.
